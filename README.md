[Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/) is a fantastic framework for generating cross-device hybrid apps quickly and easily. It is a great step in the right direction from Cordova/PhoneGap, which feels dated. So why, then, another library?

## Cordova was a great start

## Ionic made it easier

## What Capacitor got right

## What Capacitor got wrong

## Platform support

As you can see I'm pretty ambitious about truly cross-platform. Although priority sits with web/ios/android.

 - [ ] android
 - [ ] ios
 - [ ] web/pwa
 - [ ] electron
 - [ ] MacOS
 - [ ] Windows
 - [ ] Qt
 - [ ] NativeScript
 - [ ] React Native
 - [ ] [Universal Windows Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/)
 - [ ] [Catalyst](https://9to5mac.com/guides/project-catalyst/)

## What's in a name?

Since this is inspired by Capacitor, I thought it would be good to find something similar. The [Namelix](https://namelix.com/app/?keywords=capacitor) tool gave some great suggestions, and `pentode` caught my eye. [Here's a good distraction for you.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentode)
